# Node.js + Express.js + Clean Architecture

This is the spike code to architect node.js, express.js using clean architecture.

## Architecture Overview
This project's architecture is based on Uncle Bob's [The Clean Architecture.][1] Please at least skim through his blog
as you will have a better understanding of how it works.

We are separated this application into 4 different layers
  1. Domains (highest)
  2. Use cases
  3. Interfaces
  4. Infrastructure (lowest)

The gist of it is a separation of concerns. Outer layer (lower) can reference (or know) the inner (highest) layer, however, the inner layers __can not__ know about outer layer. We accomplished this by using [Dependency Injection][2] and [Duck Typing][3] since Javascript doesn't have the concept of Interface.


```
(highest)                                    (lowest, most detail implementation)
domains ---> user cases ---> interfaces ---> infrastructure
```
## Run the server
```
$ npm install
$ NODE_ENV=development node server.js
```
